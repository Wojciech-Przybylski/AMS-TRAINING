# **John And His Markdown Journey**

## *Chapter 1*
John had been a trainee software engineer for a few months now, and he was eager to keep learning and growing. One of the skills he wanted to master was markdown on Visual Studio Code. He had heard that it was a valuable tool for software engineers, so he was determined to learn it.

## *Chapter 2*
John spent countless hours studying the markdown syntax, and familiarizing himself with Visual Studio Code's interface. He practiced writing code using the markdown language, and tweaking the settings in Visual Studio Code to get the desired effect.

John learned using tools such as :


	| Syntax| Description    |
    | # H1  | Large heading  |
    | ## H2 | Medium heading |
    | ### H3| Small heading  |


## *Chapter 3*
After a few weeks of hard work, John finally felt comfortable with the tools. He proudly showed off his newfound skills to his colleagues, who were impressed with his determination and dedication.

-His colleauges names were:-
- Jim
- Jan
- Wilma
- Arnold

## *Chapter 4*
John's newfound skills made him an even more valuable member of the team. He was able to write cleaner, more organized code with the help of markdown and Visual Studio Code. He was also able to communicate more effectively with his colleagues, as they had a shared understanding of the markdown language.

John was extremely happy with his achievement so much so he has written down a list of steps of how to learn markdown quickly:

1. Join a QA training course
    - here is the website [QA](https://www.qa.com)
2. Listen very carefuly to the coach 
3. Try using what you learned by practicing the syntax
